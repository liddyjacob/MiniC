# MiniC

A compiler for a class project. 

### Recent updated:

* Expression type checking is done in *expr\_typing.cpp*, with 
supplimentary files *expr\_rules.hpp* and *expr\_conv.hpp*

* Conversions are applied in *expr\_conv.hpp*

### Updates to come:

* There is no build tree yet, but most tools are separate from their classes, so making a build tree should be easy

* Lexing is the next thing do to after that.
